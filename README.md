## Background 📖

We’re living in a digital age where technology had a transformative effect on the way we live and work. Slowly and steadily, technology has been making strides in revolutionizing methods of learning and teaching. Technology-enabled curriculum and smart boards have long replaced traditional blackboards and two-dimensional textbook images.

We are creating an immersive and interactive learning experience without the use of textbooks. We are empowering learners with<b> Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality </b> so they can explore and expand their creativty without any hinderance, thus stimulating learning, comprehension and enhances critical retention. In short, a VR and AR-based app for education, that combines digital technologies with learning to improve the educational process allowing students to acquire information in a more retainable and impactfull appraoch.

Here are some of the key benefits of using Webin<b>AR</b> in education and learning.

- Facilitates student learning through gamification and interactivity
- Keeps students engaged even while learning difficult topics
- Enhances creative thinking
- Fewer distractions
- Can be used for practical training

## About Our Product 🔧

#### We at team Alpha Beta Debug, propose a Web-application which is educative, personalized and most importantly affordable. Our web-app called 'Webin-AR' serves the purpose of educating and helping the students as well as the teachers during this time of the pandemic. This web-app focuses on both primary and secondary education, it helps the students to learn and visualize basic concepts. We do not store any essential data, as Security of the system is our priority. The WebApp provides minimalist interface aimed at users from all age groups.

#### With our product, we have implemented a full fledged classroom experience for the students as well as teachers. We have created separate portals for the faculty and students. Once everyone has signed up to the web-app. The user can simply login using their credentials to their respective portal. 

#### The faculty portal will be having a video call feature named 'Webin-AR Meet', where the teacher will be starting the class from one end and the students can join using the classroom credentials given by the teacher. The video call feature allows a better interaction between the teacher and students which is lacking at this time of the pandemic. The video call is secure and by using an App ID and a Token ID,students can only then join the class.

#### The faculty portal also has a feature of speech detection and then recognizing the 3D models to be displayed to the students when the teacher is dictating the notes. As mentioned the teacher can now pick any model from the recognized ones and it also allows the students to use it freely by rotating and zooming it. The models are open source and if any model is not there in the recognized models, there is always an option to add a 3D model.
